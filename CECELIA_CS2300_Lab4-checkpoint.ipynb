    "**Accuracy**\n",
    "The modified dataset at 20% test size had an accuracy rate difference of +0.90%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the smaller dataset. Most text lingo utilize short versions of words such as \"u\" for \"you\" and \"4\" for \"four\". By removing these type of words, the model would have to sift through less data, thus the probability of learning data increases due to the higher chance of spam related words being fed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparcity**\n",
    "The modified dataset had a difference in sparcity value of +0.04%. This increase in sparcity can again be attributed to removing alphabetized words and words less than 3 chars in length. By removing captial letters, we effectively split the rate of occurance of 5+ char words between the lowercase and uppercase versions, thus increasing the amount of columns in the sparcity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of words**\n",
    "The modified dataset had a difference in the number of columns in the bag of words of -35.80%, and a difference in size of -54.83%. This decrease in the bag of words size can be attributed to the total amount of words lost due to remove all non-lowercase chars and words with less than 3 chars. Less words in the data set means a smaller bag of words. Texting lingo typically contains simple words and use of numbers, meaning the likelyhood of using 3-letter words is higher than other forms of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of words**\n",
    "Comparing the size of the dense array to the sparse array for the bag of words, we can clearly see the incredible data compression sparcity allows. The sparse bag of words is 294,968 Bytes while the dense version is 315,176,368 Bytes; a difference of 99.91%. This dramatic size difference would also translate to faster calculations as less data needs to be fed into the algorithm."

    "# More Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cecelia Henson\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modularity\n",
    "A practical benefit of functional programming is that it forces you to break apart your problem into small pieces. Programs are more modular as a result. It’s easier to specify and write a small function that does one thing than a large function that performs a complicated transformation. Small functions are also easier to read and to check for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ease of debugging and testing\n",
    "Testing and debugging a functional-style program is easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is simplified because functions are generally small and clearly specified. When a program doesn’t work, each function is an interface point where you can check that the data are correct. You can look at the intermediate inputs and outputs to quickly isolate the function that’s responsible for a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is easier because each function is a potential subject for a unit test. Functions don’t depend on system state that needs to be replicated before running a test; instead you only have to synthesize the right input and then check that the output matches expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composability\n",
    "As you work on a functional-style program, you’ll write a number of functions with varying inputs and outputs. Some of these functions will be unavoidably specialized to a particular application, but others will be useful in a wide variety of programs. For example, a function that takes a directory path and returns all the XML files in the directory, or a function that takes a filename and returns its contents, can be applied to many different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time you’ll form a personal library of utilities. Often you’ll assemble new programs by arranging existing functions in a new configuration and writing a few functions specialized for the current task."

    "# Iterators\n",
    "An iterator is an object representing a stream of data; this object returns the data one element at a time. A Python iterator must support a method called `__next__()` that takes no arguments and always returns the next element of the stream. If there are no more elements in the stream, `__next__()` must raise the StopIteration exception. Iterators don’t have to be finite; it’s perfectly reasonable to write an iterator that produces an infinite stream of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in `iter()` function takes an arbitrary object and tries to return an iterator that will return the object’s contents or elements, raising TypeError if the object doesn’t support iteration. Several of Python’s built-in data types support iteration, the most common being lists and dictionaries. An object is called iterable if you can get an iterator for it.\n",
